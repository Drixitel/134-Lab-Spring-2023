# Millikan Files & Extra tutorials 
- Pandas 
- Jupyter Notebooks 
# !Warning!
- This was the first lab attempted multiple issues arose 
- Several files do not work and the results are not done well 
- Most of the effort was placed on completeing the lab on time and getting comfortable with writing 
  - This goal was acomplished however the analysis suffered 

# Results 
- If more trial were done properly we would have seen serval droplets centered about integer values 
- A gaussian fit could be done about each integer value to categroize the drops that fall within that range 
- This would prove each subset could be divided by thier respective integer value to measure the fundamental charge 
- Another Gaussian fit could be constructed to establish the accuracy of meausre
